                    Taking me away and he better not try to stop her. He said, no way, she couldn't leave.
                    That's when I started getting scared for both of us, my mom and me. How the hell did she know about
                    that? He would think for sure I told her. And then he'd do what he had promised he'd do every night he held me under the crush of his
                    putrid skanky body. I knew I had to get out of there. I put all my stuff together as quick and quiet as
                    possible-just some clothes, and this one stuffed lamb my mom gave me when I was little and my
                    piggy-bank money that I'd been saving—and I climbed out the win- dow of the condo. It was a hot night and I could smell my own
                    sweat but it was different. I smelled the same old fear I'm used to but it was mixed with the night and the air and the moon
                    and the trees and it was like freedom, that's what I smelled on my skin.
                    Same old boring boring story America can't stop telling itself. What is this sicko fascination?
                    Every book and movie practically has to have a little, right? But why do you think all those
                    runaways are on the streets tearing up their veins with junk and selling themselves so they can
                    sleep in the gutter? What do you think the alternative was at home?
                    I booked because I am not a vic- tim by nature. I had been planning on leaving, but I didn't
                    want to lose my mom and I knew the only way I could get her to leave him was if I told her what
                    he did. That was out of the question, not only because of what he might do to me but what it
                    would do to her.I knew I had to go back and help her, but I have to admit to you that at that moment I was
                    scared shitless and it didn't seem like the time to try any heroics. That's when I knew I had to
                    get to the desert because there was only one person I had in
                    the world besides my mom. I really love my mom. You know we were like best friends and I didn't even really need any other
                    friend. She was so much fun to hang with. We cut each other's hair and shared clothes. Her taste
                    was kind of youngish and cute, but it worked because she looked pretty young. People thought we
                    were sisters. She knew all the song lyrics and we sang along in the car. We both can't carry a
                    tune. Couldn't? What else about her? It's so hard to think of things sometimes, when you're
                    trying to describe somebody so someone else will, know. But that's the thing about
                    it-no one can ever know. Basically you're totally alone and the only per- son in the world who
                    made me feel not completely that way was her because after all we were made of the same stuff.
                    She used to say to me, Baby, I'll always be with you? No matter what happens to me I'm still
                    here. I believed her until he started coming into my room. Maybe she was still with me but I
                    couldn't be with her those times. It was like if I did then she'd hurt so bad I'd lose her
                    forever. I figured the only place I could go would be to the desert, so ·I got together all my money and went to
                    the bus station and bought a ticket. On the ride I started getting the shakes real bad thinking
                    that maybe I shouldn't have left my mom alone like that and maybe I should go back but I was
                    chickenshit, I guess. I leaned my head on the glass and it felt cool and when we got out of the
                    city I started feeling a little better like I could breathe. L.A. isn't really so bad as people
                    think. I guess. I mean there are gangs at my school but they aren't really active or vio- lent
                    except for the isolated incident. I have experienced one big earth- quake in my life and it
                    really didn't bother me so much because I'd ways,if rather feel out of control at the mercy of nature than other you know what I mean. I just closed
                    my eyes and let it ride itself out. I kind of wished he'd been on top of me then because it
                    might have scared him and made him feel retribution was at hand, but I seriously doubt that. I
                    don't blame the earth for shaking because she is probably so sick of people fucking with her all
                    the time-building things and poi- soning her and that. L.A. is also known for the smog, but my
                    mom said that when she was growing up it was way worse and that they had to have smog alerts all
                    the time where they couldn't do P.E. Now that part I would have liked because P.E. sucks. I'm not very athletic, maybe 'cause I smoke, and I
                    hate getting undressed in front of some of those stupid bitches who like to see what kind of
                    underwear you have on so they can dis you in yet another ingenious way. Anyway, my smoking is
                    way worse for my lungs than the smog, so I don't care about it too much. My mom hated that I
                    smoke and she tried everything- tears and the patch and Nicorette and homeopathic remedies and
                    trips to an acupuncturist, but finally she I was wanting a cigarette bad on that bus and thinking about how it would taste, better than the
                    normal taste in my mouth, which I consider tainted by him, and how I can always weirdly breathe
                    a lot better when I have one. My mom read some- where that smokers smoke as a way to breathe
                    more, so yoga is supposed to help, but that is one thing she couldn't get me to try. My grand-
                    mother, I knew she wouldn't mind the smoking-what could she say? My mom called her Barb the
                    chim- ney. There is something so dry and brittle, so sort of flammable about her, you'd think
                    it'd be dangerous for her to light up like that. I liked the desert from when I visited there. I liked that it was hot and clean-feeling, and the
                    sand and rocks and cactus didn't make you think too much about love and if you had it or not.
                    They kind of made your mind still, whereas L.A. —even the best parts, maybe especially the best
                    parts, like flowering trees and neon signs and different kinds of eth- nic food and music-made
                    you feel agitated and like you were never really getting what you needed. Maybe L.A. had some
                    untapped resources and hidden treasures that would make me feel full and happy and that I didn't know about yet but I wasn't dying to find them just then. If I had a choice
                    I'd probably like to go to Bali or someplace like that where people are more natural and believe
                    in art and dreams and color and love. Does any place like that exist? The main reason L.A. was
                    okay was because that is where my mom was and anywhere she was I had decided to make my home.
                    On the bus there was this boy with straight brown hair hanging in his pale freckled face. He
                    looked really sad. I wanted to talk to him so much but of course I didn't. I am freaked that if
                    I get close to a boy he will somehow find out what hap- pened to me—like it's a scar he'll see or a smell or something,
                    a red flag- and he'll hate me and go away. This boy kind of looked like maybe something had
                    happened to him, too, but you can't know for sure. Some; times I'd think I'd see signs of it in
                    people but then I wondered if I was just trying not to feel so alone. That sounds sick, I guess,
                    trying to almost wish what I went through on some- one else for company. But I don't mean it
                    that way. I don't wish it on anyone, believe me, but if they've been there I would like to talk
                    to them about it. The boy was writing furiously in a notebook, like maybe a journal, which I thought was cool.
                    This journal now is the best thing I've ever done in whole life. It's the only my good thing really that
                    they've given me here. One of our assignments was to write about your perfect dream day. I wonder what this boy's
                    perfect dream day would be. Probably to get to fuck Pamela Lee or something. Unless he was
                    really as cool as I hoped, in which case it would be to wake up in a bed full of cute kitties
                    and puppies and eat a bowl full of chocolate chip cookies in milk and get on a plane and get to go to a warm, clean, safe place (the cats and dogs would arrive there
                    later, not at all stressed from their journey) where you could swim in blue-crystal water all
                    day naked without being afraid and you could lie in the sun and tell your best friend (who was
                    also there) your funniest stories so that you both laughed so hard you thought you'd pop and at
                    night you got to go to a restaurant full of balloons and candles and stuffed bears, like my birthdays
                    when I was little, and eat mounds of ice cream after removing the circuses of tiny plastic
                    animals from on top. In my case, the best friend would be my mom, of course, and maybe
                    this boy if he turned out to be real cool and not stupid. I fell asleep for a little while and I had this really bad dream. I can't remember what it was
                    but I woke up feeling like someone had been slug- ging me. And then I thought about my mom, I
                    waited to feel her there with me, like I did whenever I was scared, but it was like those times
                    when he came into my room—she wasn't anywhere. She was gone then and I think that was when I
                    knew but I wouldn't let myself. I think when you are born an angel should say to you, hopefully kindly and not in the fake voice of an airline attendant:
                    Here you go on this long, long dream. Don't even try to wake up. Just let it go on until it is
                    over. You will learn many things. Just relax and observe because there just is pain and that's
                    it mostly and you aren't going to be able to escape no matter what. Eventually it will all be
                    over anyway. Good luck. I had to get off the bus before the boy with the notebook and as I passed him he looked up. I
                    saw in his journal that he hadn't been writing but sketching, and he ripped out a and handed it
                    to me. I saw it.
