                <p>
                    In 1944 W. H. Auden decreed that Grimm's fairy tales are "among the few indispensable,
                    common-property books upon which Western culture can be founded... [I]t is hardly too much to say
                    that these tales rank next to the Bible in importance."
                    Auden was in one sense right. Like the Bible, fairy tales-especially the classic tales of Charles
                    Perrault and the Brothers Grimm-hold a revered if not sacred place in modern Western culture. Often
                    thought to reach back like sacred works to "times past," to some ancient, pristine age in which
                    their original tellers spoke mythic words of revelation, folk tales and fairy tales are endowed by
                    many readers with unassailable moral and even spiritual authenticity.
                    Because such tales had their genesis in an oral tradition, we are tempted to imagine their original
                    tellers as simple folk endowed with infallible wisdom and, in some cases, divine inspiration. As a
                    consequence of that belief, tampering with the classic texts of Perrault or the Brothers Grimm is
                    considered by some to be tantamount to sacrilege, similar to revising the text of the Holy
                    Scriptures. As one of my undergraduate students remarked in a journal he kept while studying fairy
                    tales in the winter term of 1990: “I am not a deeply religious person. However, I have a vague
                    feeling that questioning the origin of fairy tales is somehow sacrilegious." Some traditionalists
                    even go so far as to argue that the common practice of replacing Sneewittchen, the Grimms' original
                    German spelling of Snow White, with the more modern orthographical form Schneewittchen constitutes
                    "monument desecration."
                    When classic stories are changed unacceptably, the blame is often placed on the
                    culture industry—publishers, advertisers, merchandisers, and even pedagogues who have capitalized on
                    the mass appeal of the traditional tales and emptied them of their original vigor and truth.
                    Disney's Americanized and romanticized fairy-tale movies, for example, have been severely criticized
                    for trivializing and betraying the original themes, thus enfeebling an important cultural
                    possession.3 As the civilized entrepreneur and creator of the fairy tale as consumer romance,4
                    Disney is the absolute antithesis of the mythic peasant or Ice Age storyteller, from whom we have
                    supposedly inherited this allegedly sacred possession.
                    While this religious or quasi-religious reverence is certainly appealing and even reassuring, it is
                    dangerously misleading. As an antidote to it, consider two of the twenty- four theses offered by the
                    German writer Wolfdietrich Schnurre in a piece he aptly entitled "Heretical Thoughts on the Treasury
                    of Fairy Tales." In a sardonic letter to the long deceased Brothers Grimm, Schnurre seeks to explain
                    why he thinks fairy tales have lost their value for us. "The primary guilt for the decline of the
                    fairy tale,” he claims, "rests with those who [originally] made them. They forgot to impress on them
                    the stamp of copyright.” In this case, not the culture industry, but the folk themselves are held
                    responsible for the fairy tale's bankruptcy. Ironically, the fairy tale's status as communal
                    property is proposed as the very cause of its neglect and demise. It is a fairy tale, Schnurre
                    asserts, to believe “that fairy tales are the property of the Volk—the people. Property is cared
                    for. The Volk,” he asserts, “has ruined fairy tales.”
                    These statements are heretical to established views that tell us not only why folktales are still
                    relevant but to whom they belong. However we might feel about the tales of the Brothers Grimm or
                    Perrault, Schnurre's provocative assertions raise intriguing questions about the reception and
                    cultural ownership of fairy tales. Who are the folk, that anonymous group we often view as the
                    originators and owners of the fairy tale? And if the tales do not belong to the folk, then to whom
                    do they belong? And, finally, why does the issue of ownership matter at all?
                    The Nationalistic View of Folklore
                    The concept of "the folk" is a slippery one. To some, the folk are an ethnic or national group
                    sharing common traditions, lore, and social or cultural traits. In general parlance, "the folk" are
                    the common folk, that is, the working or peasant classes. But as the Italian
                    folklorist Giuseppe Cocchiara has suggested, the identity of the folk transcends classes and "is the
                    expression of a certain vision of life, certain attitudes of the spirit, of thought, of culture, of
                    custom, of civilization, which appear with their own clearly delineated characteristics.”7 While
                    Cocchiara's definition avoids the class bias of earlier definitions, Alan Dundes excises the ethnic
                    and national emphasis by defining the folk as "any group of people whatsoever who share at least one
                    common factor."
                    However, for the Grimms and many early folklorists, it was the so-called common people who best
                    embodied a nation's folk life. It was their lore—including their folktales -that was to become the
                    reservoir and model of national character. As the product of the German folk, the tales were thought
                    to contain the scattered fragments of ancient Germanic myth, which—when collected—would provide the
                    German people with a magic mirror in which they could discern and thus reassert their national
                    identity. In this way, the Grimms' collection of folktales was conscripted into nationalistic
                    service and became a political weapon in the Grimms' intellectual resistance to the Napoleonic
                    occupation of their beloved Hessian homeland.
                    To define the folk in nationalistic terms establishes fairy tales as national property. They are
                    either yours, or they are mine. Following—and, it must be emphasized, grossly exaggerating—the
                    Grimms' nationalistic understanding of fairy tales, many Germans were only too ready to exercise
                    their right of ownership by advocating the Grimms' tales as a national primer, after 1871, for the
                    newly unified nation. In 1899, for instance, Carl Franke gave this explanation of the close link
                    between the Grimms' tales and the education of a nation:
                    To the spirit of German schoolchildren the tales have become what mother's milk is for their
                    bodies—the first nourishment for the spirit and the imagination. How German [are] Snow White, Little
                    Briar Rose, Little Red Cap, the seven dwarfs! Through such genuine German diet must the language and
                    spirit of the child gradually become more and more German....2
                    Given the Grimms' precedent and given the need of every new state to authenticate its self-image, we
                    can understand such remarks; just as we can understand the lamentable exploitation of the Grimms'
                    tales under National Socialism, which points up all too clearly the dangers inherent in viewing
                    fairy tales as the property of a single group or nation. But there is another, hidden danger in this nationalistic view. Ironically, the abuse of the
                    Grimms' tales by the culture industry of National Socialism has reinforced prejudice against the
                    Grimms' tales. So compelling was the German identification of Germanic folktales with national
                    identity that the Grimms' stories have very often been accepted as belonging uniquely to the
                    Germans. But instead of identifying favorable cultural traits in the tales, some readers have
                    discerned more ambiguous characteristics. In 1939, Vincent Brun accused the Germans of perverting
                    the fairy tale by exploiting its rude primitive instincts to educate and not to amuse children. By
                    the end of World War II, the German fairy tale had fallen into such disrepute that during the Allied
                    occupation of Germany fairy tales were viewed with serious suspicion and banned from the public
                    school curriculum. Evidently, Auden's reclamation of the Grimms' tales as common property in 1944
                    was not universally accepted; in 1947 T. J. Leonard let loose with his infamous attack on German
                    fairy tales, which he unequivocally condemned as relics of Germanic barbarism, and blamed for
                    promoting German nationalism and sadistic behavior among Germans. The reverberations of such attacks
                    on Germanic folktales and German national character can still be felt. In 1985, Siegfried Heyer
                    published an abridged German translation of Leonard's attack, and Jörg Becker, in response,
                    reflected on the enduring image of the “ugly German.” That the alleged connection between German
                    national character and fairy tales should occupy scholars forty years after the war is not
                    surprising given that Germans, as well as their former adversaries, have kept this essentially
                    postwar issue alive.
                    In 1978, Louis Snyder repeated the thesis he first put forth in the 1950s that the Grimms' tales,
                    having played a role in the development of modern German nationalism, emphasize "such social
                    characteristics as respect for order, belief in the desirability of obedience, subservience to
                    authority, respect for the leader and the hero, veneration of courage and the military spirit,
                    acceptance without protest of cruelty, violence, and atrocity, fear of and hatred for the outsider,
                    and virulent anti-Semitism."10 Readers like Snyder clearly relinquish title to the tales and deed
                    them back to their owners. The nationalism implicit in the message is clear: these tales are yours
                    (German), not mine (American).
                    Differentiating between tales belonging to different countries, and thus differentiating between the
                    countries themselves, has become standard practice. In his study of the French folktale during the
                    Old Regime, the historian Robert Darnton has insisted on the unique characteristics of the French
                    folktale that distinguish it from its German counterpart. Darnton summarizes the differences in this
                    way:
                    Where the French tales tend to be realistic, earthy, bawdy, and comical, the German [tales] veer off
                    toward the supernatural, the poetic, the exotic, and the violent. Of course, cultural differences
                    cannot be reduced to a formula-French craftiness versus German cruelty-but the comparisons make it
                    possible to identify the peculiar inflection that the French gave to their stories, and their way of
                    telling stories provides clues about their way of viewing the world.
                    Although Darnton tries to avoid stereotyping national character by adding a disclaimer and by
                    referring instead to differing world views, in the final analysis his implicit notion of fairy tales
                    as culturally defined property makes this difficult. However, he is at least aware of the danger of
                    idealizing the national ethos. In pointing to the similarity between the tales of French peasants
                    and those of Perrault, Darnton says that both groups of “tales communicated traits, values,
                    attitudes, and a way of construing the world that was peculiarly French. To insist upon their
                    Frenchness,” he notes, “is not to fall into romantic rhapsodizing about national spirit, but rather
                    to recognize the existence of distinct cultural styles, which set off the French ... from other
                    peoples identified at the time as German, Italian, and English."12 Perhaps it is easy for Darnton to
                    avoid rhapsodizing because he is not French. That is, the tales he discusses are “theirs,” not his.
                    Although the French are not immune to praising the unique nature of their national fairy tales, they
                    seem to be less dependent on the tales for the codification of their self- image than are the
                    Germans. France lacked—indeed, did not need-strong nationalistic voices such as those of the
                    Brothers Grimm, who set the German precedent for folktale worship. Moreover, because the French
                    enjoyed a strong literary heritage, they were perhaps more likely to find models of the national
                    ethos in their classical canon than in popular folk literature. After all, unlike the Grimms' tales,
                    Perrault's stories are usually considered not so much examples of the folk culture as part of the
                    elevated literary tradition of the Old Regime. Although Robert Darnton might find the French popular tale
                    characterized by the earthy and bawdy, Paul Hazard praises Perrault's fairy tales for their
                    expression of such typically French characteristics as logic, wit, and refined femininity.13 Fernand
                    Baldensperger, not without irony, has even observed that Perrault's fairies are charming Cartesian
                    fairies.
                    The pride the French take in their tales rarely gets more impassioned than this. Perhaps this also
                    has something to do with the influential essay on Perrault written by Sainte-Beuve in 1851, in which
                    he stressed not only the naivete and simplicity, but also the universal appeal of the French
                    stories.
                    Such a view draws on another interpretation of the folk that does not rely on national or ethnic
                    identity and consequently proposes an alternative ownership for the fairy tale. This view of the
                    folk is informed by a universalizing tendency that completely disregards social, historical, and
                    cultural factors. It is the view espoused in particular by psychoanalytic, archetypal, and
                    anthroposophical-spiritualist (Waldorf school) readers of fairy tales.16 It is best summed up in
                    this amazingly wrongheaded passage taken from the book Fairy Tales and Children by psychologist
                    Carl-Heinz Mallet:
                    Fairy Tales are popular poetry, for they originated and developed among the people [the folk]. They
                    were born in fusty spinning rooms. Simple people told them to simple people. No one else was
                    interested in these "old wives' tales." No superior authority, whether profane or ecclesiastic,
                    exerted any influence. Fairy tales developed outside the great world, beyond the centers of
                    political and cultural power. They absorbed nothing from these areas, no historical events, no
                    political facts, no cultural trends. They remained free of the moral views, behavioral standards,
                    and manners of the various epochs.... Human beings per se are the focal point of fairy tales, and
                    people are pretty much alike no matter when or where they have lived.
                    This is in striking contrast to the opinions discussed earlier in this chapter. Here the folk
                    constitute not a national group bound together by a common culture, but an ill- defined population
                    of idyllic innocents whose sole characteristic is simplicity. Rousseau is responsible for this
                    model. But both this mythical peasant and the ensuing notion of a fairy tale untouched by its social or historical context are ridiculous. Yet these are the very
                    premises upon which very influential and popular theories of the fairy tale have been built. Their
                    unfortunate success lies in their reassuring appeal to our humanity, to the soothing promise that
                    both human beings and values transcend time and space. In other words, as vessels of purportedly
                    universal human truths, fairy tales belong to us all. The classic example of this view is Bruno
                    Bettelheim, whose popular psychoanalytic interpretations of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm and
                    Perrault have been widely and enthusiastically embraced.
                    Bettelheim's Psychoanalytic Interpretations of Fairy Tales
                    From Bettelheim's psychoanalytic perspective, fairy tales address "essential human problems" and
                    "have great psychological meaning.”18 Through fairy tales, Bettelheim argues, both children and
                    adults can find their way through life's existential dilemmas. Bettelheim can come to these
                    conclusions because he assumes that fairy tales transcend the specific time and place of their
                    origin and give us insight into "manifold truths ... which can guide our lives;... truth as valid
                    today as it was once upon a time."19 Thus, fairy tales, whether German or French, for example, would
                    seem to belong to us all, not simply by virtue of our sharing a common Western culture, but because
                    the fairy tale's transcendent nature addresses our common humanity. However, Bettelheim's point of
                    view is problematic because what he believes to be universal truths ultimately turn out to be the
                    values of nineteenth-century Europe.
                    The repressive moralizing inherent in Bettelheim's readings of fairy tales has been solidly
                    criticized before, but I mention the issue again here because his understanding of fairy tales
                    remains influential, especially among teachers and children's librarians who often rely on his work.
                    *** Jack Zipes's criticism of Bettelheim's "Use and Abuse of Folk and Fairy Tales with
                    Children,"20 in particular, deserves reading or rereading in light of the recent, sobering
                    allegations by one of Bettelheim's former patients at the Orthogenic School that the author of The
                    Uses of Enchantment was an authoritarian who physically and emotionally abused children in his
                    care.21 The values that Bettelheim views as timeless and common to us all frequently turn out to be
                    those of the authoritarian, patriarchal society in which he was raised.
                    Some of Bettelheim's influence has been mitigated by recent studies that reveal the
                    specific sociocultural roots of many tales and thus expose their historically determined values. In
                    fact, for the last fifteen years the Grimms' tales have been the center of considerable discussion
                    and controversy as a result of renewed interest in evidence that the Grimms did not give us
                    authentic, unaltered folktales transcribed from the mouths of simple people, but instead drew many
                    of their tales from highly educated informants or printed literary texts. That Wilhelm Grimm had
                    freely revised, edited, added to, and basically rewritten many of the classic tales to reflect his
                    own aesthetic and moral values renders the universal, transcendent view of these tales untenable.
                    ***
                    But the discrediting of theories has affected not only those who, like Bettelheim, believe in the
                    universal nature of fairy tales. The nationalists have had to confront the discovery that many of
                    the best known and most cherished of the Grimms' tales are not purely German. They are in many cases
                    of mixed origin. Some of the Grimms' most significant informants have turned out to be educated
                    bourgeois women from families of French Huguenots who had settled in Germany after the revocation of
                    the Edict of Nantes. Of course, to say that these oral sources spoke French and were familiar with
                    the tales of Perrault is not to say that what the Grimms have given us is a collection of French
                    tales. They did not. But it is enough to undermine the view that makes fairy tales the possession of
                    a single nationality.
                    We are left, however, with a question. If fairy tales are not the universal possession of an
                    all-encompassing, undifferentiated humanity, and if they are not the sole property of any single
                    national group, then to whom do fairy tales belong? This question can be best answered by turning
                    first to the question: Why does it matter at all to whom fairy tales belong?
                    The question of ownership is not an idle question. As we've seen, our specific views on the origin
                    and nature of fairy tales necessarily imply that we have, implicitly or explicitly, a specific
                    attitude toward their ownership. And these attitudes, in turn, have an impact on the reception of
                    fairy tales insofar as they determine how we both read and use fairy tales. The problem—indeed, the
                    danger—with both the nationalistic/ethnic and universal views of fairy tales is that they prescribe
                    forms of thought and behavior, and modes and models of humanity, that are meant to be normative.
                    That is, they stereotype us—either as members of a nationalistic or ethnic group, or as human beings defined by a
                    certain concept of what is or is not normal. This is why fairy tales have been so frequently
                    utilized by both nationalists and universalists in the socialization of children. In both cases,
                    fairy tales are supposed to depict or prescribe for us what is true, as well as what forms of
                    behavior are typical, normal, and acceptable. Whether we view them as yours and mine or as ours,
                    fairy tales—read from these perspectives—confine and limit us, narrowing our views of reality while
                    allegedly giving us greater insight into the other, into ourselves, or into humanity. From these
                    perspectives, fairy tales own us, we don't own them.
                    An important twist was added to the question of ownership with the proliferation of both printed
                    texts and copyright law in the nineteenth century. While folktales remain in the public domain
                    because of their anonymous origin in the oral tradition (which accounts in part for their popularity
                    among publishers), there has been a growing tendency to stress private ownership by individuals or
                    even corporations. This is evident in the way we speak about fairy tales. With deference to the
                    folk's public ownership of fairy tales, the Grimms claimed only to have collected the stories in
                    their famous edition. Yet we refer to them as "Grimms' fairy tales." Contemporary storytellers, who
                    work for a fee and are cautious about allowing audio or video recordings of their performances,
                    frequently talk of making a traditional folktale their own. Although this is in one sense an
                    artistic claim, the vocabulary of ownership clearly implies the expectation to control and profit
                    from the tale in question. When Disney called his animated fairy tales by his own name—Walt Disney's
                    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty, and so on- —he was not simply making
                    an artistic statement, but also laying claim to the tales in what would become their most widely
                    known, public versions. In 1989, when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences used the
                    figure of Snow White in its televised award ceremonies, the Walt Disney Company filed a lawsuit
                    claiming "unauthorized use of its Snow White character," which the corporation felt had been treated
                    in an unflattering manner in the comical and mildly satirical sketch.23 When the Walt Disney Company
                    spent $1 million for the videocassette rights to the "Rocky and Bullwinkle” series—including the
                    "Fractured Fairy Tales" that sometimes parody the Disney versions and Walt Disney himself—its
                    corporate ownership and control of the fairy tale were extended to even the subversive fairy tale.24
                    If the Walt Disney Company cannot completely prevent unflattering parodies of its fairy-tale movies and their creator,
                    at least it will now be able to control and profit from their distribution.
                    The Disney case demonstrates that the question of ownership is important because it is ultimately a
                    question of control. So who owns fairy tales? To be blunt: I do. And you do. We can each claim fairy
                    tales for ourselves. Not as members of a national or ethnic folk group as French, German, or
                    American. Not as nameless faces in a sea of humanity. And not in the Disney model as legal copyright
                    holders. We claim fairy tales in every individual act of telling and reading. If we avoid reading
                    fairy tales as models of behavior and normalcy, they can become for us revolutionary documents that
                    encourage the development of personal autonomy.
                    As some revisionist writers and storytellers have already recognized, the removal of the fairy tale
                    from the service of nationalism and universalism requires the subversion of traditional tales. Thus
                    we find contemporary literary versions of “Little Red Riding Hood," for instance, that offer
                    alternative visions. In one version, by the Merseyside Fairy Story Collective, a young girl
                    overcomes her fear and slays the wolf who threatens her grandmother.25 In another, by Angela Carter,
                    a young woman, far from becoming the wolf's innocent victim, accepts her animal nature—her
                    sexuality—and actually leaves her family and village to join the company of wolves.26 In other
                    media, such as film, video, and music, attempts have also been made to reclaim the fairy tale. In
                    fact, Angela Carter's Red Riding Hood story, "The Company of Wolves," has itself been remade as a
                    movie.27 And some of the irreverent video adaptations in Shelley Duvall's Fairie Tale Theatre28 go a
                    long way toward offsetting the saccharine Disney model of the Consumer Romance. Even in popular
                    music the Disney claim on meaning has been challenged by authorized remakes of the songs from Walt
                    Disney's fairytale movies. Sinéad O'Connor's subtly ironic rendering of "Someday My Prince Will
                    Come," Betty Carter's sensual subversion of "I'm Wishing,” and Tom Waits's industrialized "Heigh Ho❞
                    give us the opportunity to reinterpret Disney and “his” tales for ourselves and our time.29
                    Discovering Individual Ownership of Fairy Tales
                    The opportunity to reclaim fairy tales is as crucial for children as it is for adults. But the right
                    to ownership of the tales may in some ways be more difficult for children to claim. After all,
                    teachers, librarians, parents, and powers in the culture industry exert
                    a certain control over the popular reception of fairy tales by determining to a great extent not
                    only the nature of the tales that are made accessible to children, but also the context of their
                    reception. A storyteller who buys into myths about the pristine origin of fairy tales assumes an
                    unearned mantle of authority and shrouds the stories not only in mystery but in error. A parent
                    under Bruno Bettelheim's spell uses time- bound tales to justify a timeless moral authority. And a
                    teacher concerned about the so- called crisis of cultural literacy will emphasize canonized
                    fairy-tale texts and treat them as sacred cultural artifacts. In each case, children's responses are
                    expected to conform to the external authority of the tales they read or hear. It is no accident that
                    parents and educators so often praise fairy tales because of their ability to enchant children.
                    Stripped of sentimentality, enchantment—that is, being spellbound and powerless-is also a curse. We
                    applaud the rescue of a Frog King or a Sleeping Beauty who is powerless to break the spell of a
                    malevolent force, but when a moralistic text "enchants" and has a child in its spell, we apparently
                    have that child exactly where we want her or him.
                    There are at least two ways in which children can be awakened from this form of enchantment and
                    helped to discover their individual ownership of fairy tales. First, teachers and parents can offer
                    children a wider variety of fairy tales than is usually proffered. Complementing the classic tales
                    and anthologies with newer or lesser-known stories and variants places the traditional tales in a
                    context that encourages diverse responses, questions, and significant comparisons—even among
                    elementary school children. When I read my own daughter the Grimms' "Little Red Riding Hood" and the
                    version of the Merseyside Fairy Story Collective, for example, she announced that she liked the
                    second version better "because the little girl was smarter.”
                    ***
                    Beyond presenting children with a variety of fairy tales, adults can also encourage the creative
                    reception of fairy tales. In other words, children can make fairy tales their own by creating and
                    re-creating their own versions. There is good evidence that given the opportunity, children will
                    take fairy tales into their own hands in any case. In his book on the Brothers Grimm, Jack Zipes has
                    recounted how fifth- and sixth-grade girls combined the character of Peter Pumpkin-Eater and the
                    story of Cinderella into a new tale that explicitly reflects their developing sexuality and
                    consciousness.And Kristin Wardetzky has shown how the storytelling of children in the former East Germany does not always
                    succumb to the dominant cultural models and re-creates the fairy tale in ways that express the
                    children's power over the genre.
                    At the end of his list of heresies Wolfdietrich Schnurre wonders, "Can the fairy tale be saved?" His
                    answer: "Perhaps. If specialists expose the roots of the tales and tell them in a way that is
                    thoroughly new and which expresses their essence." "Writers and professional storytellers
                    retelling tales and making them their own can indeed renew the fairy tale. But readers,
                    too—including children—can reread and reinterpret the tales in new ways. By experiencing a wide
                    variety of tales, they can view the stories of the classical canon in new context. By actively
                    selecting, discussing, enacting, illustrating, adapting, and retelling the tales they experience,
                    both adults and children can assert their own proprietary rights to meaning. It is no heresy to
                    re-appropriate the tales from either tradition or the culture industry. "They are not," as Auden
                    knew, "sacred texts."33 If the fairy tale needs saving and if we are to save it, then we need to
                    abandon the untenable views of its ownership that put us in its power. We must take possession of it
                    on our own terms. Saving the fairy tale in this way is nothing less than saving our very selves.
